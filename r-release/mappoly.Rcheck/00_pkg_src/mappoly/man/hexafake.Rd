\title{Simulated autohexaploid dataset.}
\format{
An object of class \code{mappoly.data} which contains a
    list with the following components:
\describe{
    \item{m}{ploidy level = 6}
    \item{n.ind}{number individuals = 300}
    \item{n.mrk}{total number of markers = 1500}
    \item{ind.names}{the names of the individuals}
    \item{mrk.names}{the names of the markers}
    \item{dosage.p}{a vector containing the dosage in
      parent P for all \code{n.mrk} markers}
    \item{dosage.q}{a vector containing the dosage in
      parent Q for all \code{n.mrk} markers}
    \item{sequence}{a vector indicating the sequence each marker
      belongs. Zero indicates that the marker was not assigned to any
      sequence}
    \item{sequence.pos}{Physical position of the markers into the
      sequence}
    \item{geno.dose}{a matrix containing the dosage for each markers (rows) 
      for each individual (columns). Missing data are represented by 
      \code{ploidy_level + 1 = 7}}
    \item{n.phen}{There are no phenotypes in this simulation}
    \item{phen}{There are no phenotypes in this simulation}
    \item{chisq.pval}{vector containing p-values for all markers associated to 
                      the chi-square test for the expected segregation patterns 
                      under Mendelian segregation}
