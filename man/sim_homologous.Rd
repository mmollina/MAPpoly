\usage{
sim_homologous(
  m,
  n.mrk,
  min.d = 0,
  max.d = m + 1,
  prob.dose = NULL,
  max.ph,
  restriction = TRUE,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{ploidy level. Must be an even number}

\item{n.mrk}{number of markers}

\item{min.d}{minimum dosage to be simulated (default = 0)}

\item{max.d}{maximum dosage to be simulated (default = m + 1)}

\item{prob.dose}{a vector indicating the proportion of markers for
different dosage to be simulated (default = NULL)}

\item{max.ph}{maximum phase difference}

\item{restriction}{if TRUE (default), avoid cases where it is impossible to
estimate recombination fraction and/or linkage phases via
two-point analysis}

\item{seed}{random number generator seed}
}
\value{
a list containing the following components:
  \item{hom.allele.p}{ a list of vectors
   containing linkage phase configurations. Each vector contains the
   numbers of the homologous chromosomes in which the alleles are
   located. For instance, a vector containing \eqn{(1,3,4)} means that
   the marker has three doses located in the chromosomes 1, 3 and 4. For
   zero doses, use 0}
  \item{p}{contains the indices of the starting positions of the
    dosages, considering that the vectors contained in \code{p} are
    concatenated. Markers with no doses (zero doses are also
    considered)}
  \item{hom.allele.q}{Analogously to \code{hom.allele.p}}
  \item{q}{Analogously to \code{p}}
}
\description{
Simulate two homology groups (one for each parent) and their
linkage phase configuration.
}
\details{
This function prevents the simulation of linkage phase
configurations which are impossible to estimate via two point
methods
