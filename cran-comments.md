## Re-submission of MAPpoly package

This is a re-submission of the MAPpoly package, previously archived because CRAN 
was unable to reach the maintainer due to an outdated email address. 
The maintainer email has been updated and the package is actively maintained 
again.

This submission contains maintenance updates only; no major functionality changes 
were introduced.

Thank you for reviewing our re-submission!
