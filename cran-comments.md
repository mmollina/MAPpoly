## Resubmission of MAPpoly package

This is a resubmission of the MAPpoly package, previously archived because CRAN
was unable to reach the maintainer due to an outdated email address.
The maintainer email has been updated and the package is now reachable.

This submission contains maintenance updates only; no major functionality changes
were introduced.

Thank you for reviewing this resubmission.
